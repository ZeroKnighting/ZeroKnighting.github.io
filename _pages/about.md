I am a final-year undergraduate student at Fudan University majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My academic journey has been enriched by diverse research experiences, including foundation models for molecules and materials at Microsoft Research and the application of large language models. I have also contributed to award-winning projects in CPU design and achieved recognition in competitive programming contests.
