I am a final-year undergraduate student at Fudan University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My academic pursuits are driven by a passion for cutting-edge research, with experience spanning the development of foundation models for molecules and materials at Microsoft Research and the innovative application of large language models.

In addition, I have contributed to award-winning projects in CPU design and earned accolades in prestigious competitive programming contests. I am excited to further my academic journey and make meaningful contributions to the field of computer science.
